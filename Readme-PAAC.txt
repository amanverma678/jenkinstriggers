This code defines a Jenkins pipeline, which automates the process of fetching code from a Git repository, building it using Maven, running unit tests, and archiving the built artifacts. Steps are

Agent Configuration
The agent any directive means the pipeline can execute on any available agent (Jenkins worker node).

Tool Configuration:
Maven and JDK tools are configured using the tools block.
It specifies the versions of Maven ("MAVEN3") and JDK ("OracleJDK8") to be used during the pipeline execution.
Stages:

Stages represent the different phases of the pipeline.
Fetch Code Stage:
This stage is named 'Fetch code'.
Inside this stage, the pipeline fetches the code from a Git repository using the git step.
It specifies the branch (vp-rem) and the URL of the repository (https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-repo.git).

Build Stage:
Named 'Build'.
In this stage, the pipeline builds the code using Maven.
The sh step executes a shell command. It runs the Maven command mvn install -DskipTests, which installs dependencies and packages the application into a WAR file. The -DskipTests option skips running tests during the build process.
After the build, the post section defines actions to be taken based on the result of the stage.
In case of a successful build (success), it echoes a message and archives the built artifacts using the archiveArtifacts step. It archives all files matching the pattern **/target/*.war.
Unit Test Stage:

Named 'UNIT TEST'.
This stage runs unit tests using Maven.
The sh step executes the Maven command mvn test, which runs all unit tests in the project.
